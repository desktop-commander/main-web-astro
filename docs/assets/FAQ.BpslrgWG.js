It enables LLMs to explore, read, and write files, execute commands, and manage processes - expanding their capabilities beyond just conversation to become a comprehensive assistant that can work with your entire operating system."},{question:"How does it differ from coding tools like Cursor or Windsurf?",answer:"Unlike tools like Cursor or Windsurf which are primarily designed as coding IDEs, Desktop Commander works with Claude to provide a more flexible, solution-centric approach. It's not confined to a coding box - it can handle coding tasks but also excels at exploring codebases, drawing diagrams, running automation processes, and working with multiple projects simultaneously."},{question:"What is an MCP?",answer:"MCP stands for Model Context Protocol. It's a framework that allows AI language models like Claude to interact with external tools and services. MCPs give Claude the ability to perform actions in the real world - in this case, to read and write files, execute terminal commands, and manage processes on your computer."},{question:"How much does it cost to use Desktop Commander?",answer:"Desktop Commander itself is free and open-source. However, to use it, you need a Claude Pro subscription, which costs $20/month. There are no additional charges beyond this subscription fee."},{question:"Which operating systems does it support?",answer:"Desktop Commander works with Windows, macOS, and Linux, with ongoing improvements for better cross-platform support."},{question:"How does Desktop Commander collect feedback and usage data?",answer:"It has three systems: local usage analytics (always active, stays on your machine), anonymous telemetry (can be disabled), and optional feedback system (user controlled)."},{question:"Is it safe to give Claude access to my file system?",answer:"Claude operates within safety boundaries - it typically only works with files you direct it to, can only perform actions your user account has permission for, and no data is sent to external servers beyond Claude conversations."},{question:"I'm having trouble installing or using the tool. Where can I get help?",answer:"Join our Discord server for community support, check the GitHub issues for known problems, or review our comprehensive FAQ for troubleshooting tips. If you encounter a new issue, please consider opening a GitHub issue with details about your problem."}];return e.jsx("section",{ref:t,id:"faq",className:"py-20 bg-muted/30",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"container mx-auto px-4",children:[e.jsxs("div",{className:`text-center mb-16 transition-all duration-1000 ${o?"opacity-100 translate-y-0":"opacity-0 translate-y-8"}`,children:[e.jsx("h2",{className:"text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-4",children:"Frequently Asked Questions"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto",children:"Got questions?
